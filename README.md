Folder of shame- projects I haven't or won't start. 

- On My Way, simple app to send SMS messages that include ETA ([BUILT!!](http://samgarst.com/OMW)!)
- MLB Bell, that rings every time a Phillies player hits a home run. (Ah! Started!)
- Constellation of lights, expressing Conway's game of life using individual lights communicating wirelessly.
- Refurbish my polygraph machine.
- Simple mobile app to track where we parked our car (NFC Chip?).
- Video camera and AI to monitor free parking spaces in my neighborhood, and send alerts appropriately.
- Something to help my mom stay independent, and her kids to stay calm.
- Something better to save online reading material for perusal later (sooo many solutions, all overkill for what I need).
- Something to track movies and books, automagically search/add to my FreeLibrary interlibrary loan or Amazon queue.
- Something to help me track my daughters (god d**m) migrane headaches, and maybe point to triggers.
- Some way to counter the advocates who claim to speak for all, when they only really speak for the militant few. 
- Some way to tip or buy a beer for people that are doing good work, without being all awkward about it. Anonymous beer?
- A simpler way to manage my volunteer work, which requires coordination with a large group of tech-savvy and tech-phobic people. Some want email, some text/SMS, some need phone calls, some want faxes, all deserve to participate.
